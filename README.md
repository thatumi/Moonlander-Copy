A Moonlander clone submitted as homework for Basics of Programming 1. 

**SDL 2 is required for the program to run.**

## Game Rules: 
In the game, the user controls a spaceship. The goal of the game is for the player to successfully land while navigating their spaceship. The conditions for a successful landing are as follows:
- Do not land on uneven terrain.
- Do not get too close to the ground with the thrusters on.
- At the moment of landing, the horizontal speed should not be too high.
- At the moment of landing, the vertical speed should not be too high.
- If you run out of fuel, the spaceship crashes.



## Views: 
There are two types of views: the main menu, where you can start a new game or exit the program, and the game view itself. You can access the game view from the main menu by starting a new game. 
## Map: 
The game features generated 2D terrains. These terrains are uneven, but there is always a flat surface suitable for landing.
## Controls/Input: 
You can control the spaceship using the right and left arrow keys and the spacebar. The spacebar turns off the thrusters, pressing the up arrow increases the thrust. The right and left arrow keys adjust the lateral acceleration. You can save the map with key F5, and load it with F9.
## HUD: 
In the game view, the spaceship's dashboard is located in the upper right, where you can see the spaceship's altitude, horizontal and vertical speeds, fuel level, and the contact light, which indicates whether you are close enough to the ground to turn off the thrusters.
